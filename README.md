# Overview

A simple (currently write-only) EEPROM programmer for the Greenliant GLS29EE010 using the Digilent Cmod A7.

Feature-equivalent versions exist in both SystemVerilog and [Clash](https://clash-lang.org/).

# Building

Make a Vivado project and add all the HDL sources and constraints.
Follow the constraints file to figure out how to wire it up.

# History

I wrote this for my Fall '19 ECE 110 final project.
